Welcome to Coloressa! Coloressa is color picker and explorer that aims to give you the simplest and most elegant way to discover colors, color families, shades, tints, variants, and more. It aims to be a design tool that only adds to your productivity and makes tasks like finding a shade of gray and copying it to your clipboard a very simple task indeed.

## A little background
Coloressa has been created by me, Obi Nwokogba. As a full-stack web developer and graphic designer, a lot of times I noticed that it was tasking to find a color-picker that was simple enough and powerful enough. I noticed 'little' things like the fact that most color pickers online might generate just 8 shades and tints of a color. No more. I thought..."well, it would be nice if you generated 15 or even 20 shades and tints of this color. Please give me options!". This realization persisted for years. 

Coloressa was created as a solution. A solution to the world of exploring, refining, and picking colors. I hope Coloressa becomes your design buddy, helping you as a tool that only adds ease, joy, and productivity to your design work!
